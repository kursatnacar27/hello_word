hello word my new user name is kadir kur≈üat nacar.
  I hope there are many quality people in this field.
I started with spending time at a post-secondary university primarily and about software.
  We are having difficulties as a comparative language on many issues.
  We can't find much tukish language support as coding. I would be very happy for those who help me.
